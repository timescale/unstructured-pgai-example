# Unstructured + pgai

This is a quick start to use Unstructured to ingest any document into PostgreSQL and run semantic search on it.

With this setup, the document on your postgresql database will be vectorized and you can run semantic search on it.

The [import.sh](import.sh) script imports the document into PostgreSQL and vectorizes the content of the document.

    participant T as TimescaleDB
    participant P as pgai
    participant O as pgai Vectorizer

    U->>S: Input raw documents
    S->>S: Extract and structure data
    S->>T: Store structured data
    P->>O: Configure pgai Vectorizer
    T->>O: Process text data
    O->>O: Generate vector embeddings
    O->>T: Store vector embeddings
    U->>T: Query data
    T->>P: Generate embedding for query data
    T->>T: Perform vector similarity search
    T->>U: Return relevant results
    U->>U: Analyze insights
```

The best part of unstructured is that it can ingest a lot of different file types and structure the content of the file in a way that is easy to query.

It supports csv, html, pdf, word, excel, image, markdown, and more.

This example covers a generic ingest of any data file and also a python script to ingest a web page.

# Setup

Copy the `.envrc.example` file to `.envrc` and edit it to set the correct environment variables.

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

Open `.envrc` and set the correct environment variables. The file includes settings for:

- PostgreSQL connection details (for local setup or Timescale Cloud)
- OpenAI API configuration
- Unstructured API settings
- Other project-specific settings

For local setup, you can use a pre-built Docker container:
https://github.com/timescale/pgai?tab=readme-ov-file#use-a-pre-built-docker-container

For production use, we recommend using Timescale Cloud:
https://github.com/timescale/pgai?tab=readme-ov-file#use-a-timescale-cloud-service
Sign up for a free trial and enable the pgai extension for your service.

Make sure to set the following key variables:

- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`: TimescaleDB connection details
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for text processing tasks
- `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`: API key for the Unstructured service (if using the hosted version)

You can adapt the openai model or the embedding model to your needs directly in the schema.sql file.

Adjust other settings as needed for your specific use case.

After setting up the environment variables, run `install.sh` to install the necessary dependencies.

Run `import.sh` to import the data into TimescaleDB.

Example:

```bash
./install.sh
./import.sh import/my/file.pdf
```

# Database schema

By default, the database schema is created using the `schema.sql` file.

It creates a table `elements` that includes all the fields that Unstructured can extract from a document.


# Importing data from HTML

You can use the import.sh script to import data from HTML files too.

```bash
./import.sh import/my/file.html
```

In this case, if you don't have data files to play, I recommend you to use the unstructured project that contains a lot of data files to play with.

```
git clone https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured
```

Then, you can run the following command to import the data from the HTML files:

```bash
./import.sh ../unstructured/example-docs/example-10k.html
```

Now, with a 10k file, it will have an output like this:

:warning: The above output is truncated. Also, note that the skip_download and skip_partition options are set to true, so the partition and download steps are skipped as they're already done.

Now, let's take a look at the data filtering by the `type` field:

```sql
select languages, type, text from elements where type = 'Title' ;
 languages | type  |                                        text
-----------+-------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {eng}     | Title | UNITED STATES
 {eng}     | Title | SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
 {eng}     | Title | Washington, D.C. 20549
 {eng}     | Title | FORM
 {eng}     | Title | For the transition period from to
 {eng}     | Title | Commission file number:
 {eng}     | Title | ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 {eng}     | Title | ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021
 {eng}     | Title | TABLE OF CONTENTS
 {eng}     | Title | SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
```


You can also find nearest elements by the embeddings using the `<=>` operator:

```sql
vector_playground=# select type, text from elements order by embeddings <=> embedding('Tax')  limit 10;
       type        |   text
-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Title             | FORM
 Title             | BUSINESS
 NarrativeText     | The income tax expense was $48,637 in 2021 based on an effective rate of 2.25 percent compared to the benefit of ($605,936) in 2020 based on an effective rate of 17.42 percent. The 2.25 percent effective tax rate for 2021 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0 percent and was primarily attributable to (i) increased tax benefit from the exercise of stock options; (ii) the increased foreign rate differential and (iii) the Company maintaining a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
 UncategorizedText | 11
 Title             | GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 UncategorizedText | 35
 UncategorizedText | 41
 Title             | UNITED STATES
 UncategorizedText | 45
```

The `embeddings` field is the embedding of the text column of the element. And, you can use a semantic search to find the nearest elements to a given embedding.

```sql
vector_playground=# select text from elements where type = 'Title' and embeddings <=> embedding('first day of the year') < 0.2;
                  text
----------------------------------------
 YEARS ENDED December 31, 2021 AND 2020
 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND 2020

 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND 2020

# Importing content from web pages

The other example fetches the TimescaleDB documentation and inserts into the database using the `fetch_timescale_pages.py` script.

```bash
python fetch_timescale_pages.py
```
It will fetch the documentation from the TimescaleDB website and insert it into the database.

Then, you can run a semantic search using the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT url, text FROM elements
WHERE url ~ 'docs.timescale.com'
ORDER BY embeddings <=> embeddings('install timescaledb-ha via docker') LIMIT 1;
```

# Importing content from PDF files

Unstructured has a lot of data files to play with. If you have a PDF file, you can import it into the database using the following command:

```
./import.sh ../unstructured/example-docs/embedded-images.pdf
```

And, you can run a semantic search using the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT text
FROM elements
WHERE filename ~ 'embedded-images.pdf'
ORDER BY embeddings <=> embedding('Hands Free') LIMIT 2 ;
                    text
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 "HANDS-FREE" CARD: use (2/4)
 Hands-free unlocking, when approaching the vehicle; With the card in access zone 3, the ve- hicle will unlock. Unlocking is indicated by one flash of the hazard warning lights and the indicator lights.
